A brief overview of your glassyPDM desktop client settings.

## Server Folder
### Server Folder Location
You can change the location of the glassyPDM folder, and have the option to move project files to the new folder.
### File Cache
You can enable or disable the cache.
While downloading files, glassyPDM will cache downloads in a folder (`.glassycache`) before assembling and copying files to their location in the project.
Enabling the cache will keep the cache folder around after downloading, which means resetting files will take shorter as you won't need to re-download previous revisions.
Disabling the cache will clear the cache folder after downloading, which is helpful if you are working on a laptop or have limited space on your hard drive.

If you have the cache enabled, you can clear the cache easily here too.
## App Data
Typically you won't need to view app data or logs, but if you want to clear space on your hard drive deleting the logs is an option.
:::caution
Deleting the `glassypdm.db` file located in your app data will force you to re-configure your client, i.e., input a server URL and selecting a folder.
