description: Setting up permissions for your team members
---

## tl;dr
- Team members have read permissions and no write permissions for projects by default
- Team members should be added to a permission group to gain write permission for a set of projects
- Team managers have read and write permissions by default, can create projects, and add team members
- Team owners are the same as team managers, but can promote members to managers
## Permission Groups
Permission groups are used to organize write permissions for projects.
Team managers and owners have the ability to create and manage permission groups for a team.
Permission groups for a team can be viewed and managed in the Permission Groups tab.

Once a permission group has been created, projects and members can be added to it.
The end result is that members inside a given permission group will have write access
for the projects in the permission group.
